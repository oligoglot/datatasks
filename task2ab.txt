2. SQL
a) What is the relation between Database, Schema, Tables, View in PostgreSQL / MySQL?
Database is the largest physical container within which all data objects are stored.
--------                --------
A Schema is a logical grouping of SQL objects. Each database can have multiple schemas 
  ------      ----------------
depending on the applications that use them. Permissions can be specified at schema
level.
Table is a physical storage of rows and columns.
           ----------------
A view is usually a logical table (sometimes materialised into a physical storage).
                    -------        ----------------------
It is specified by a query which can be a join of multiple tables or views. Every
time a logical view is accessed, its underlying query is also run.

b) What is the difference between a table and a view?
A table is always stored physically.
A view is almost like a table, but with the following key differences:
A view may or may not be materialised.
A view is a standing query and can be a join on multiple tables. 
A view is typically used for simplifying complex queries by providing a table-like abstraction
for intermediate results.
A view is not suitable for running DML statements unless all fields required to maintain 
constraints are present.
